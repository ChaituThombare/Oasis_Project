This repository contains two distinct applications: a **Number Guessing Game** and an **Online Reservation System**. Each project is designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and interactive GUI design using Java.

# Task 1: Number Guessing Game

## Description
The Number Guessing Game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a set range and number of attempts. It provides immediate feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Features
- Random number generation
- User input through GUI
- Feedback mechanism to guide the player
- Score tracking based on the number of guesses

## Usage
- Start the application.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to guess numbers.
- View your score after each round.

# Task 2: Online Reservation System

## Description
The Online Reservation System allows users to book, view, and cancel reservations. This system is particularly designed to handle transportation or event booking scenarios.

## Features
- User authentication (Login system)
- Reservation form for booking tickets
- Cancellation interface to manage bookings
- Storage and retrieval of reservation data

## Usage
- Log in using the credentials provided or register a new account.
- Navigate to the reservation page to make a new booking.
- Use the cancellation page to cancel existing bookings.

# Technologies Used
- **Java**: Main programming language
- **Swing**: GUI toolkit for Java
- **File I/O**: For managing user and reservation data

## Prerequisites

Before running the applications, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Java SE 11 or higher recommended. This is essential as both applications are built using Java.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Any Java-supporting IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. This will help in compiling and running the Java files.
- **File System Access**: Ensure that the account running the applications has appropriate permissions to read from and write to the disk, as both applications involve file I/O operations.

# Installation
To run these applications, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Java JDK is installed on your computer.
3. Compile the Java files using your preferred Java compiler or IDE.
4. Execute the compiled classes to launch the applications.
