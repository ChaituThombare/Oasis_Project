This repository contains three distinct applications: a Number Guessing Game, an Online Reservation System, and an ATM Interface. Each project is designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, interactive GUI design, and application-specific functionalities using Java.

# Task 1: Number Guessing Game

## Description
The Number Guessing Game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a set range and number of attempts. It provides immediate feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

## Features
- Random number generation
- User input through GUI
- Feedback mechanism to guide the player
- Score tracking based on the number of guesses

## Usage
- Start the application.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to guess numbers.
- View your score after each round.

# Task 2: Online Reservation System

## Description
The Online Reservation System allows users to book, view, and cancel reservations. This system is particularly designed to handle transportation or event booking scenarios.

## Features
- User authentication (Login system)
- Reservation form for booking tickets
- Cancellation interface to manage bookings
- Storage and retrieval of reservation data

## Usage
- Log in using the credentials provided or register a new account.
- Navigate to the reservation page to make a new booking.
- Use the cancellation page to cancel existing bookings.

# Task 3: ATM Interface

## Description
The ATM Interface application simulates a real-world ATM machine. The application is designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, interactive GUI design, and secure transaction processing in Java.

## Feature
- **User Authentication**: Validates user credentials before allowing access to ATM functions.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Allows users to check their current account balance.
- **Money Deposit**: Enables users to deposit money into their account.
- **Money Withdrawal**: Allows users to withdraw money from their account.
- **Funds Transfer**: Facilitates transferring funds between accounts.
- **Transaction History**: Displays a list of all recent transactions made by the user.
- **Session Management**: Securely manages user sessions to prevent unauthorized access.

## Usage
- **Start the Application**: Launch the ATM interface application.
- **Login**: Authenticate using a username and password.
- **Navigate**: Use the on-screen buttons to navigate through different services like balance check, deposit, withdrawal, transfer, and viewing transaction history.
- **Perform Transactions**: Follow prompts to deposit, withdraw, or transfer funds.
- **Logout**: Securely logout of the application once tasks are completed.

# Technologies Used
- **Java**: Main programming language
- **Swing**: GUI toolkit for Java
- **File I/O**: For managing user and reservation data

## Prerequisites

Before running the applications, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Java SE 11 or higher recommended. This is essential as both applications are built using Java.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Any Java-supporting IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. This will help in compiling and running the Java files.
- **File System Access**: Ensure that the account running the applications has appropriate permissions to read from and write to the disk, as both applications involve file I/O operations.

# Installation
To run these applications, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Java JDK is installed on your computer.
3. Compile the Java files using your preferred Java compiler or IDE.
4. Execute the compiled classes to launch the applications.
